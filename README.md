## Authentication
You can find more details of the endpoints of the api <a href="/server/README.md">here</a>. Futhermore, here are some gifs showcasing the app (it is still a work in progress, but at least it already works)
The authentication API was made using JWT as authentication token and bcrypt as encryption. Although i made an authentication system, it wasnt the focus of this project, but so the chat part you will see below.

## Chat
The main focus of this project, the web sockets. I decided to write an mini chat using web sockets to learn a little about web sockets. Web sockets are a good alternative to HTTP when you need a more constant communication between client and server, which is the case of a chat. If you want to know more about Web sockets, i recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc6U93P4Sxw">this</a>
